-- name: GetExclusiveBuildsForTemplateDeletion :many
-- Returns builds that are ONLY assigned to this template (safe to delete).
-- Builds shared with other templates are excluded.
-- DISTINCT needed because builds may have multiple tag assignments to the same template.
-- Joins envs (not active_envs) so the query works after the template is soft-deleted.
